https://github.com/nickgag626/RedHatExercise

```

Write a simple procedure of your choice (for example, how to make a bed, how to change a tire on a car or bicycle, or how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich) in HTML or Markdown and publish it using GitHub Pages. <br></br>
While you should use the writing style and presentation that you believe to be most suitable, the content of this procedure will not be assessed. Send us the link to your GitHub Pages site displaying your procedure and the link to your GitHub repository containing your source code.
