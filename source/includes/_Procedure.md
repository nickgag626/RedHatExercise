# Procedure

Follow the step-by-step directions below to create your delicious PB&J sandwich. 

1. Place each slice of bread face-up on the table, exposing the maximum amount of surface area. 
2. Open both the jar of peanut butter and the jar of jelly. 
   * To open the jars, twist the lid counter clockwise until it is loose enough to be removed. 
3. Pick the butter knife up (by the handle) so that the sharp half is facing away from you. 
4. Insert the knife into the opening of the peanut butter jar, and perform a scooping motion until the knife is coated. 
5. Withdraw the coated knife from the jar, and apply the peanut butter in a spreading motion across the face of the bread. 
   * Continue spreading until the peanut butter is transferred from the knife's blade to the bread's face. 
6. Once you've determined that the bread is sufficiently buttered, you can stop spreading. 
7. Take the knife (once again by the handle), and insert it into the opening of your jelly jar, repeating step 4. 
5. Once again, withdraw the coated knife from the jelly jar and apply it in a spreading motion across the face of your **second** piece of bread. 
   * Continue spreading until the jelly is transferred from the knife's blade to the bread's face. 
6. Put the knife down. 
7. Finally, take the two pieces of bread and press them together so that the two coated-faces meet. 
8. You have successfully created a peanut butter and jelly sandwich!
